The project will ensure that national policies and planning frameworks identify and protect wetlands of global biodiversity significance and protect globally threatened species, including migratory species and improve transboundary cooperation. Awareness on and capacity of Nepal to engage in and to promote international policies and collaborative efforts for wetland conservation will be strengthened.  It has been designed to influence two cycles of national and local development plans and to allow adequate time to achieve visible results and proper stakeholder takeover of project activities. Partnerships and capacity will be developed at both national and local levels to effect long-term changes to the perception, value, and sustainable management of wetlands in Nepal to ensure sustainability and replication of project initiated actions even after project end. The project will produce three Outcomes. These include Outcome 1 \"Wetland biodiversity conservation values integrated into national policy and planning framework\", Outcome 2 \"Strengthened national institutional, technical and economic capacity and awareness for wetland biodiversity conservation and sustainable use\" and Outcome 3 \"Enhanced collaborative management of wetland resources for conservation and sustainable livelihoods\".","output_id":"00049898","output_title":"Conservation &Sustainable use"}],"project_descr":"Conservation & Sustainable Use of Wetlands in Nepal","project_id":"00042939","project_title":"Conservation & Sustainable use of Nepal Wetlands","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2007-03-14","subnational":[{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"27.025","lon":"85.5773","name":"Haripur","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.59716","lon":"87.06512","name":"Laukahi","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.64512","lon":"87.06674","name":"Madhuwan","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.692","lon":"87.08834","name":"Prakashpur","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.563","lon":"87.01951","name":"Sripurjabdi","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.75639","lon":"86.97817","name":"Tapeswori","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.61053","lon":"86.91023","name":"Badgama","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.58651","lon":"86.92228","name":"Bairawa","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.60738","lon":"86.89903","name":"Baramjhiya","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"27.75551","lon":"85.34536","name":"Dharampur","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.66627","lon":"86.92284","name":"Ghoghanpur","precision":"3","type":"PPLL"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"27.5746","lon":"84.30734","name":"Jagatpur","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.68761","lon":"86.94818","name":"Kamalpur","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.70462","lon":"86.96846","name":"Odraha","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"26.65494","lon":"86.94196","name":"Pipra Purba","precision":"3","type":"PPLL"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"28.6394","lon":"80.9511","name":"Darakh","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"},{"awardID":"00042939","lat":"28.6883","lon":"80.9933","name":"Sadepani","precision":"3","type":"ADM4"}]}
