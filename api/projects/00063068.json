Main barriers that have limited Vietnam in its ability to deal with chemical related problems are associated to (i) insufficient capability and resources to manage chemical sector in effective and environmental sound manner; (ii) Lack of enabling environment to facilitate the sound management of chemicals (SMC); (iii)  lack of effective co-ordination, unclear division of responsibility and overlapping mandates of various institutions involving in chemical management. \r\n\r\nIn order to consolidate sound management of chemical (SMC) in Vietnam, the project will provide technical assistance to the Government of Vietnam (GoV) to address the above mentioned barriers, to promote sound management of chemicals and its integration into economic planning and decision making. The project also helps the GoV to fulfill its commitments to associated international conventions it has ratified.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "UNEP"], "expenditure": [43502.0, 150931.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00080385", "output_locID": "00080385-1", "name": "Ha Noi", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "21.0245", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00063068", "lon": "105.84117", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Viet Nam", "budget": 489604.0, "iati_op_id": "VN", "inst_descr": "Ministry of Industry and Trade", "start": "2012-06-01", "operating_unit_id": "VNM", "expenditure": 194433.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00063068", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.vn/", "project_title": "sound management of chemicals"}
