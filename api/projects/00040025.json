The project will achieve its objectives by supporting an integrated set of six component programs comprising: policy and institutional support development; communications and awareness; technical capacity development; energy efficiency services provision support; financing support; and demonstrations. The successful implementation of the project will result in the cumulative energy saving of 136.1 kilotons of oil equivalent and the cumulative carbon dioxide annual emission reduction of 962.0 ktonnes during the period 2006-2010", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [317437.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Viet Nam", "budget": 329047.0, "iati_op_id": "VN", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2005-10-21", "operating_unit_id": "VNM", "expenditure": 317437.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/VNM/00040025/00045088_PECSME Prodoc.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00040025", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.vn/", "project_title": "energy efficiency and conservation"}
