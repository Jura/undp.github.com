Even though country terrestrial species diversity is relatively low due to Egypt's general aridity, many species are very narrowly distributed, making habitat conservation crucial to their survival. Marine biodiversity is also significant, with Egypt's Red Sea coral reefs showing considerable endemism. There is also important genetic diversity. At least 143 species of threatened animals are to be found. Three main categories of persisting threats and associated causes of biodiversity loss have been identified. These are: (i) conversion and/or destruction of natural habitats; (ii) degradation of natural habitats, and; (iii) unsustainable utilization of biodiversity resources. Protected areas have a potentially critical role to play in reducing the above threats to Egypt's biodiversity. Egypt's system of protected areas (PAs) is divided geographically into five management units: Sinai, Cairo, Western Desert, Red Sea and Upper Egypt. Currently, Egypt's 27 PAs cover 148,023 km2, or about 15% of the nation's total land area. The proposed long-term solution for biodiversity conservation of Egypt's protected areas is an effective and sustainable PA system operated by an autonomous NCS that has the financial wherewithal and management capacities needed for effective management. The foundation of the long-term solution is a sustainable financing system resting on the following three pillars: (i) Legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks that support sustainable PA financing; (ii) Tools and practices for revenue generation and mobilization, and; (iii) Business planning and other tools for cost-effective management.  The project objective is the establishment of a sustainable protected area financing system, with associated management structures, systems and capacities needed to ensure the effective use of generated revenues for priority biodiversity conservation needs. It will achieve this objective by strengthening each of the above pillars as follows: Outcome 1: Legal, policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks that facilitate revenue generation, revenue retention and other aspects of sustainable PA financing and management are established and functional. Outcome 2: Levels of financial resource mobilization are adequate to ensure effective conservation-oriented management of Egypt's PA system. Outcome 3: Business planning and cost-effective management systems are ensuring the effective allocation and management of mobilized resources","output_id":"00071131","output_title":"Protected Areas Fin&Mgmt Syst"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening Protected Area Financing and Management Systems","project_id":"00057529","project_title":"Strengthening Protected Areas Finance&Mgmt Systems","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2009-05-27","subnational":[{"awardID":"00057529","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"30.69651","lon":"33.97038","name":"Zaranik","outputID":"00071131","precision":"4","type":"RES"}]}
