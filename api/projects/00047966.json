An important objective of the Programme is also the formation and/or strengthening of strategic partnerships with other stakeholders working in the area of human rights, with a view to ensuring mutual reinforcement of capacities.  The Programme also substantively supports knowledge management and coordination, with linkages to existing corporate Knowledge Networks, and promotes south-south cooperation. \r\nOverall Outputs of the Programme are:\r\n1. A Human Rights-Based Approach in all UNDP practice areas promoted and strengthened, and human rights\r\nmainstreamed into overall UNDP programming tools;\r\n2. Strengthened capacity of UNDP HQ staff, Regional Service Centres, as well as Country Offices to promote human rights and apply a HRBA in their work;\r\n3. Improved availability of guidance material for UNDP's cooperation with partner countries for supporting national human rights systems and applying a HRBA;\r\n4. 20-30 Country Offices supported through integrated human rights review and follow-up programming advice;\r\n5.
