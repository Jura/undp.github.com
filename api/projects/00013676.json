Simultaneous global and national benefits are expected, which would ensure both a demonstration effect and a self-sustaining local process after project completion. The project will address root causes through a revival of bio-friendly transhumance and common property management regimes, land use planning and innovative incentives for rangeland and wildlife biodiversity conservation. The GEF increment will remove institutional, economic, technological, information, and policy barriers to demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach, and its applicability to other areas characterized by aridity, ecosystems co-dependent on ruminant grazing, and traditional common property management regimes that still remain viable.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [114158.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Morocco", "budget": 147991.0, "iati_op_id": "MA", "inst_descr": "", "start": "2001-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "MAR", "expenditure": 114158.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/MAR/00013676/CBTHA Prodoc_Fran\u00e7ais.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00013676", "inst_type_id": "", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.pnud.org.ma/", "project_title": "transhumance & biodiversit\u00e9 dans le haut atlas"}
