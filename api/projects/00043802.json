Finally, a series of activities will focus on defining a detailed strategy for large-scale FCB commercialization in China. Other capacity building activities will also include expanding government policies, technical standards, enhancing domestic research and development capabilities to support FCB commercialization in China.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [1788807.0, 925801.0, 3684.0, -5.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00051247", "output_locID": "00051247-1", "name": "Beijing", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "39.9075", "type": "ADM1", "awardID": "00043802", "lon": "116.39723", "precision": "4", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "China", "budget": 938200.0, "iati_op_id": "CN", "inst_descr": "Ministry Of Science And Techno", "start": "2007-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "CHN", "expenditure": 2718287.0, "document_name": [["PRODOC.pdf", "Fuel-Cell Bus"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/CHN/00043802/PRODOC.pdf", "http://erc.undp.org/evaluationadmin/manageevaluation/viewevaluationdetail.htmlevalid=2169"], ["format", "format"]], "project_id": "00043802", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.cn/", "project_title": "pims 2933:demo -fuel cell bus commercialization phase ii"}
