The project has six main outputs. Five will deliver biodiversity conservation at the top five priority wetlands in Lithuania (Cepkeliai, Kamanos, Viesvile, Zuvintas and Girutiskis). These five demonstration sites will provide lessons learned and best practices to inform institutionalization, policy dialogue and reform regarding biodiversity conservation and economic and social benefits. The sixth output will result in a formal intersectoral mechanism for institutionalization and replication of best lessons learned in conservation of inland wetland biodiversity.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [153015.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Lithuania, Republic of", "budget": 152875.0, "iati_op_id": "LT", "inst_descr": "NATIONAL EXECUTION", "start": "2004-04-01", "operating_unit_id": "LTU", "expenditure": 153015.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LTU/00034145/wetlands.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00034145", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.lt/", "project_title": "conservation of inland wetland biodiversity in lithuania"}
