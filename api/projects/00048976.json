In partnership with BDP/CDG, DRT will provide support to three COs for DRR capacity assessments and designing capacity development strategies. DRT will also support assessment of recovery capacities in five countries that will form a basis for capacity development in this area.  Technical support will be provided in the area of risk identification to country programmes that include this area of work. The main focus of DRT's mainstreaming work  is to support the application of tools and methodologies developed in previous years to specific country contexts. One major area of support to country programmes will be in the area of climate risk management \r\nTechnical advice will be provided to selected countries on integrating DRR into the CCA/UNDAF.
