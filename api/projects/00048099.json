The project will achieve the pre-set objectives through addressing the following five components: \r\n1.) Stocktaking of the state of volunteerism in the region\r\n2.) Integration of volunteer-based approaches into development programming and highlighting relevant sub-regional and/ or regional lessons\r\n3.) Refining volunteer approaches in the four thematic areas for UNV involvement and support in Europe and CIS\r\n4.) Development of strategic partnerships\r\n5.) Advocacy and knowledge management\r\n6.)
