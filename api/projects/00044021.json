Coffee landscapes are very important for the world's biodiversity. This project will result in conservation of biologically rich coffee areas though an increase in market demand for coffee produced under biodiversity-friendly, sustainable production practices. The project will work in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru and thereby deliver impacts in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Brazilian Cerrado, Mesoamerica, and in the Tropical Andes biomes. By increasing market demand for certified coffee from all origins, the project will also produce impact in other countries where certified sustainable coffee is produced. Providing market incentives through certification, the project will achieve transformation of the coffee sector, and ensure that it becomes a valuable complement to conservation efforts in protected areas. Results will include the direct conservation of 1,500,000 hectares of coffee, up from currently 93,000, with positive biodiversity impacts across coffee landscapes, representing approximately 10-15 million hectares.  The project will foster an increase in the volume of sustainable coffee sold from 30,000 to 500,000 metric tons, with at least 100,000 of these metric tons coming from smallholders. The number of coffee companies (roasters) supporting biodiversity conservation by selling sustainable coffee will increase to more than 300. The project will work closely with governments in producer and consumer countries to make them partners in creating market-based solutions to conservation and development problems in coffee.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [2095849.0, 1051230.0, 298177.0, 472033.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00051603", "output_locID": "00051603-1", "name": "Guatemala", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "15.5", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00044021", "lon": "-90.25", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Guatemala", "budget": 2348895.0, "iati_op_id": "GT", "inst_descr": "OTRO", "start": "2006-09-08", "operating_unit_id": "GTM", "expenditure": 3917289.0, "document_name": [["Annex XV Project Coffee Region Maps.pdf", "Signature Page Coffee scanned.pdf", "Annex XX LPAC minutes.pdf", "PRODOC_firmado (Parte 4).pdf", "PRODOC_firmado (Parte 3).pdf", "PRODOC_firmado (Parte 2).pdf", "PRODOC_firmado (Parte 1).pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/Annex XV Project Coffee Region Maps.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/Signature Page Coffee scanned.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/Annex XX LPAC minutes.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/PRODOC_firmado (Parte 4).pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/PRODOC_firmado (Parte 3).pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/PRODOC_firmado (Parte 2).pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GTM/00044021/PRODOC_firmado (Parte 1).pdf"], ["format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00044021", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.pnud.org.gt/", "project_title": "biodiversity conservation in coffee"}
