The Project aims to provide assistance to scale up an existing adaptation initiative that applies a local financing and risk insurance model to rice and corn producers in vulnerable parts of North Eastern Mindanao, Philippines. \r\n\r\nThis initiation plan will be implemented from June 20, 2012 to June 20, 2013.  Within this period, consultation and data gathering will be done at the national and local level to analyze national and sub-national policies and institutional capacities for sustaining and enhancing agricultural productivity and incomes in the face of increasing climate- related hazard and extreme events and longer term variability and change. The plan also includes defining and extending partnerships to support the widespread uptake of affordable and effective financing packages including weather index based insurance, together with investments in early warning systems and green economy based livelihoods diversification.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [24519.0, 9805.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00082867", "output_locID": "00082867-1", "name": "Davao Region", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "7.5048", "type": "ADM1", "awardID": "00066836", "lon": "125.8511", "precision": "4", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"outputID": "00082867", "output_locID": "00082867-2", "name": "Northern Mindanao", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "8.5625", "type": "ADM1", "awardID": "00066836", "lon": "124.6125", "precision": "4", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Philippines", "budget": 34897.0, "iati_op_id": "PH", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2012-06-20", "operating_unit_id": "PHL", "expenditure": 34324.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00066836", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.ph/", "project_title": "scalingup risk transfer mechs for farming communitiesphl"}
