From these 6 components, the following are the expected outcomes: (a) Enhanced knowledge of potential MCT applications; system benefits, availability and cost,  as well as capacity and capability of local service providers for MCT systems; (b) Increased MCT applications in ICE sectors as well as market share of MCT, with resulting in GHG emission reduction, and reduction in MCT cost by about 25% average; c) Increased investments on MCT: banks/financing institutions providing loans for MCT projects; (d) Approval and implementation of policies supportive of MCT projects; e) Enhanced awareness of the benefits of MCT in order to increase the number of MCT users and planned MCT projects; and, f) Availability of locally made, and enhanced local manufacturing capability of MCT system components.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [699253.0, 578741.0, 311739.0, 171650.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00059512", "output_locID": "00059512-1", "name": "Jakarta", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-6.21462", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00049011", "lon": "106.84513", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Indonesia", "budget": 1201667.0, "iati_op_id": "ID", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2008-07-01", "operating_unit_id": "IDN", "expenditure": 1761383.0, "document_name": [["MCTAP ProDoc.pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/IDN/00049011/MCTAP ProDoc.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00049011", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.or.id/", "project_title": "microturbine cogeneration technology application project"}
