As part of a general objective of developing legal empowerment for the poorest and most vulnerable groups, it seems of great importance to develop knowledge of customary laws and practices throughout the country in order to efficiently combine this source of law with the broader official normative framework. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding and harmonization of customary legal practices as well as an improved access to justice and information for villagers living in out-of-reach places. It should also promote gender equality as well as an enhanced and equitable application of international Human Rights standards based on the international treaties the Lao PDR ratified.\n\nOutputs:\n\nOutput 1: Relevant database on customary laws and practices in Lao PDR created\n\nOutput 2: Formulation of a draft National Strategy on customary law based on the survey previously carried out and resulting database\"", "donor_short": [], "donor_name": ["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"], "crs_descr": "Legal and judicial development", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Lao People's Democratic Republ", "budget": 826505.0, "iati_op_id": "LA", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2008-09-01", "operating_unit_id": "LAO", "expenditure": 837393.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00050490", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "lsmp: support to implementation of legalsectormasterplan"}
