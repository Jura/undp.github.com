Heat supply in the buildings sector accounts for approximately 25% of all fuel consumed in Ukraine, and, therefore, there is a huge potential for energy efficiency improvement in this sector, which Ukraine wants to actively pursue. In line with the Government's priorities, this project addresses a key issue in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through large-scale improvements in energy efficiency in Ukraine's communal heat supply sector. As a result of the project, institutional capacities and capabilities of municipalities are strengthened through improved policies and practices related to energy services and environment and local authorities (oblast, rayon, municipality) use energy service company (ESCO) business model providing energy solutions to ensure energy savings and payback of the capital investments  to improve energy efficiency of municipal infrastructure.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [389110.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Ukraine", "budget": 423544.0, "iati_op_id": "UA", "inst_descr": "State Committee for Energy Con", "start": "2006-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "UKR", "expenditure": 389110.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/UKR/00042146/Project_Document.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00042146", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.ua/", "project_title": "energy efficiency in the district heating system project"}
