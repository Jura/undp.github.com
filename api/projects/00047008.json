To this end, the project will, in its first phase, produce a comprehensive landmine/ERW contamination survey and a national mine action strategy. The latter will be the basis for formulation and implementation of other mine actions including demining operations, mine victim assistance and mine risk education in the project's second phase. Success in these mine actions will also represent the project's contribution to Zambia's fulfilment of international obligations under the treaty on landmines.","output_id":"00056243","output_title":"Landmine survey and programme"}],"project_descr":"Support to mine action services to promote social and economic development","project_id":"00047008","project_title":"Support to mine action services to promote development","region_id":"RBA","start":"2007-07-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00047008","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"-13.06667","lon":"22.68333","name":"Chavuma","outputID":"00056243","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
