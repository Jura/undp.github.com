The core objective of the JP is to enhance  the  enabling policy environment to effectively plan and execute pastoralist related climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at federal, regional and district levels and pilot measures to enable the pastoral communities develop capacity for managing climate change risks and shocks in a total of 6 districts of 4 Regions in Ethiopia. To achieve these objectives, the JP is divided into 3 components which correspond to the 3 outcomes: \r\n\r\n1. Climate change mitigation and adaptation options  for pastoralists mainstreamed into national/sub-national and district  development frameworks (development plans, strategy, policies);\r\n2. Government and pastoral institutional capacities strengthened to effectively respond to the climate change risks and challenges; and\r\n3. Pastoral community coping mechanism/ sustainable livelihood enhanced\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  specific outputs under the custody of UNDP include:\r\n1. Federal/Regional/district and pastoral community institutions capacity and service delivery  to respond to pastoralist community needs enhanced \r\n2. Climate sensitive needs identified, assessed and priority interventions agreed\r\n3.
