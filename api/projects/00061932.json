Indonesia must also address potential impacts of projected contributions from greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions to climate change). The rapid increase of fossil fuel consumption (over 6% per year) also contributes to climate change, and in this sense Indonesia must consider both mitigation and adaptation aspects\r\nConsidering challenges through this Project Initiation Plan (PIP), UNDP will support the government in addressing the needs and priorities of Indonesia by working closely with relevant responsible party (-ies) to develop six new proposals on (1) low emission on degraded land (biochar); (2) greenhouse gases inventory (third national communications); (3) green commodities (sustainable palm oil); (4) cross protocol cooperation on emission reduction (climate benefits in Air Conditioner and refrigeration systems); (5) climate change adaptation and risk management (Climate Risk Management or CRM); and (6) private sector climate change financing initiatives.", "donor_short": ["JOHNSON &", "NGI", "UMB"], "expenditure": [161735.0, 282159.0, 4350.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"output_id": "00082420", "crs": "41010", "donor_id": ["11234", "00012"], "focus_area": "5", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "Context Assessment", "budget": [25500.0, 62990.0], "fiscal_year": [2012, 2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["Voluntary Contributions", "Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)"], "award_id": "00061932", "output_descr": "Indonesia Context-assessment for the preparation of the 'National Climate Change Capacity Building Project' proposal, under project Low Emission Capacity Building Programme (LECB)", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "AusAID"], "expenditure": [0.0, 54688.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"output_id": "00084372", "crs": "41010", "donor_id": ["10714"], "focus_area": "5", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "Support to Post2015 Dev Agenda", "budget": [17110.0], "fiscal_year": [2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["UNDP AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR A JOINT PROGRAMME PASS THROUGH ARRANGEMENT"], "award_id": "00061932", "output_descr": null, "donor_short": ["UNDP(JPAA)"], "expenditure": [17010.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00079052", "output_locID": "00079052-1", "name": "Jakarta", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-6.21462", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00061932", "lon": "106.84513", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"outputID": "00082420", "output_locID": "00082420-1", "name": "Jakarta", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-6.21462", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00061932", "lon": "106.84513", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"outputID": "00084372", "output_locID": "00084372-1", "name": "Jakarta", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-6.21462", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00061932", "lon": "106.84513", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Indonesia", "budget": 648216.0, "iati_op_id": "ID", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2011-06-01", "operating_unit_id": "IDN", "expenditure": 519942.0, "document_name": [["PIP SIMAS CC - 61932_050711.pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/IDN/00061932/PIP SIMAS CC - 61932_050711.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00061932", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.or.id/", "project_title": "strengthening indonesia mitigation and adaptation"}
