The increasing demand makes it necessary to increase the capacity of the Peace Mission Training Centre (PMTC), South Africa.

The capacity enhancement of the PMTC will lead to better trained military and security personnel capable of dealing with integrated aspects of peace support operations missions, including conflict prevention, conflict management and postconflict recovery.
