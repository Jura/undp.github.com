In West Africa, the global financial crisis and the threat of a global recession have raised new concerns about the potential impact on African economies and on prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, together with democratic governance challenges.  Across Africa, people demonstrated against desperate social and economic situations and sharp rises in living costs during 2008 (Kenya, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Mauritania). According to the 2009 UN Secretary-General Report on the United Nations Office for West Africa, transnational organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, is increasingly becoming a major source of concern in the sub region. Also, a number of issues continue to pose unacceptable threats to the security of the communities of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries. These include absence of rule of law, social and economic disputes, or human rights abuses. This situation negatively impacts on the structural stability of states, human security and economic and social development.  In order to address these challenges, activities will engage parliamentarians from the West Africa region, with a clear focus on Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau trough a dedicated strategy encompassing a cycle of activities in 2010 and 2011 on the role of parliaments in conflict prevention, recovery, small arms control and community security with the objective of ensuring stronger parliamentary oversight of security sector reform in the region. This cyclic approach, as detailed in this work plan, involves capacity development activities for parliamentarians through the establishment of a regional parliamentary working group, ad-hoc support to emerging needs in order to respond to crisis situation, and knowledge and good practice sharing across the region.", "donor_short": ["BEL", "FRA", "SDC"], "expenditure": [378755.0, 173949.0, 103913.0, -24799.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}, {"output_id": "00069940", "crs": "99810", "donor_id": ["00061"], "focus_area": "2", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "GPPS ARAB REGION", "budget": [0.0, 726382.0, 64035.0, 2.0], "fiscal_year": [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["GOVERNMENT OF BELGIUM"], "award_id": "00050304", "output_descr": "The GPPS II Mid-Term Review indicated that the Arab States regional programme, known as the \"Parliamentary Development Initiative in the Arab Region\" (PDIAR) and implemented jointly with RBAS' Programme on Governance in the Arab Region (POGAR), has been innovative and effective in building parliamentary development programming in a challenging environment. The Parliamentary Working Group model has proved a useful approach both in helping to address issues that cannot be tackled at the national level and in providing an opportunity for reform-minded MPs to collaborate together across the region.  \r\nAt the regional level, PDIAR was launched in 2004 in an effort to reinforce UNDP's position as a key actor in parliamentary development in the Arab region. It was aimed at addressing the growing demand for support in several Arab parliaments by enhancing the role, capacity and image of the legislative institutions and supporting the work of their members and administrations. It was developed on the basis of a number of documented observations and lessons learned, but most importantly, with an eye for the characteristics and realities of the Arab region, particularly in the area of democratic governance. \r\nThe Initiative has focused on:  1) creating and strengthening thematic parliamentary networks (initiated through working groups) on key and often sensitive issues for the region; 2)  addressing the knowledge deficit, especially in Arabic, by developing knowledge products to support parliamentary work in the region; 3) empowering Arab women MPs by encouraging their effective involvement in the Initiative's activities and designing specific activities on women's political empowerment, and 4) linking regional-level activities with UNDP's parliamentary development work at the country level to reinforce both levels' work.   The initiative has included ongoing support to two working groups of MPs, researchers and experts on political party legislation reform and security sector governance in the Arab region.   The initiative has also included the launch of a parliamentary development knowledge portal for the Arab Region at www.arabparliaments.org.  \r\nIn the framework of a new phase of the global programme (GPPS III) regional programming in the Arab States would include four components:  1) continued support for parliamentary working groups, 2) support for women's participation in parliament and political parties, 3) knowledge building and dissemination, and 4) partnership building and inter-project collaboration.", "donor_short": ["BEL"], "expenditure": [50954.0, 433810.0, 7210.0, -2090.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00074184", "output_locID": "00074184-1", "name": "Global", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "", "type": "", "awardID": "00050304", "lon": "", "precision": "", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "operating_unit": "Bureau for Dev.
