Integrity frameworks remain weak across the region (weakest in Central Asia), to a significant extent due to insufficient focus on corruption prevention. Based on its experience of several years working with anti-corruption agencies and on analysis of current global and regional trends, UNDP BRC has identified a number of key areas for capacity development to leverage genuine improvements in public accountability, transparency and integrity, including: capacity development support to national integrity institutions; corruption assessments and integrity strengthening in public service delivery and in local governments; support to the UNCAC review process through a transparent, participatory and comprehensive approach; advocacy, networking and knowledge facilitation. The project has been designed in close consultation with COs and its implementation will be demand-driven, cultivating programmatic linkages between the regional and country levels for enhanced impact.", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [43919.0, 137384.0, 161977.0], "crs_descr": "Public sector financial management", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00078500", "output_locID": "00078500-1", "name": "Slovakia", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "48.66667", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00061757", "lon": "19.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "operating_unit": "Bratislava Regional Center", "budget": 465000.0, "iati_op_id": "998", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2011-04-26", "operating_unit_id": "SVK", "expenditure": 343280.0, "document_name": [["ProDoc_Strengthening_Corruption_Prevention_Capacities.docx", "GOV_Strengthening Corruption Prevention Capacities_2011-2013+First.pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SVK/00061757/ProDoc_Strengthening_Corruption_Prevention_Capacities.docx", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SVK/00061757/GOV_Strengthening Corruption Prevention Capacities_2011-2013+First.pdf"], ["format", "format"]], "project_id": "00061757", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "strengthening corruption prevention capacities"}
