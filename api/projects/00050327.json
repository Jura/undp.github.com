The drivers and impacts of migration are often most strongly felt at the local level, be it in terms of effects on the local labour market, the size and demographic structure of the local population, or the need for public service provision. Local communities may also have strong ties with diaspora communities who originate from their area and can be important players in developing policies towards the diaspora. The good practices identified by the Joint Migration and Development Initiative showed the importance of efficiently linking civil society initiatives such as the ones of diaspora groups with local development agendas in order to achieve development impact and sustainability. So far, the experimentation of small scale initiatives have had positive effects and contributed to change the degree of activism of local administrations in the field of migration and development. Unfortunately, their involvement remains for the time being largely underdeveloped and many obstacles exist, such as a lack of capacities and of efficient and effective coordination within local authorities' administration and with other stakeholders. To contribute towards a higher impact of migration on local development, targeted support will be provided through 1) up-scaling selected local authorities' initiatives and provision of capacity building in target countries, 2) in the regions of intervention, networking up-scaled projects with other local development actors and sharing of lessons learnt 3) connecting local authorities internationally to facilitate partnership building and knowledge sharing.","output_id":"00087232","output_title":"JMDI-MIGRATION & DEVELOPMENT"}],"project_descr":"Programme d'Appui au D\u00e9veloppement Economique Local.","project_id":"00050327","project_title":"APPUI DEV.
