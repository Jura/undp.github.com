The expected output of the project is:\r\n- Municipalities, local development organisations and private sector are capable of planning and implementing their own path to sustainable human development in order to effectively overcome the multi-dimensional barriers to poverty reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the Srebrenica Regional Recovery Programme is to promote the socio-economic recovery of multiethnic communities with strengthened local government structures. The Programme will focus on the following expected output: \r\n- Municipalities and local development organisations are capable of planning and implementing their own path to sustainable human development in order to effectively overcome the multi-dimensional barriers to poverty reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its third phase, the programme's focus will be on supporting the local partners in creating an enabling environment for local economic development, defined as the efforts that seek to improve the economic well-being and quality of life for a community. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo do so, the Srebrenica Regional Recovery Programme is designed around four activities that will address the needs to:\r\n- develop leadership and technical competencies;\r\n- strengthen local governments and public institutions;\r\n- improve public services including public infrastructures; and\r\n- develop the private sector to create employment.\r\n\r\nThe four planned activities are:\r\n1.\tLocal Capability Development\r\n2.\tInstitutional Strengthening\r\n3.\tServices to Citizens\r\n4.\tPrivate Sector Development\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second emphasis of the programme's third phase will be on the transfer of the implementation responsibilities to the municipal authorities. Through this transfer of implementation responsibilities, the programme intends to strengthen local human and institutional capacity development. Such a modality enables local partners to increase their competencies in implementing complex development interventions with UNDP providing mentoring and coaching services. This modality also leads to increased local ownership over the programme's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the four activities are:\r\n- Increased local capabilities in participatory planning and implementation of development projects;\r\n- Increased effectiveness in the delivery of public services;\r\n- More than 6,000 people will benefit from improved living conditions; and\r\n- 500 families have increased revenues.","output_id":"00078982","output_title":"Srebrenica Regional Recovery"},{"award_id":"00057476","budget":[60000.0],"crs":"25010","crs_descr":"Business support services and institutions","donor_id":["10480"],"donor_name":["UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID)"],"donor_short":["USAID"],"expenditure":[58740.0],"fiscal_year":["2013"],"focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"The Dinaric Alps encompass the southern stretch of Alps from Slovenia through Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro to Northern Albania.

The aim of the activity is to contribute to rural development of the Dinaric Arc region through promotion of its tourism resources and potentials and provision of support to establishment of effective intra-regional partnerships. While undertaking walking journey through the five countries the following will be achieved: 1. Marking and mapping the Via DInarica Trail; 2.Conducting assessment of resources and needs of developing tourism resource inventory and 3. Providing continual international and regional media coverage of the journey. Implementation of this cross-border activity creates the platform for local communities in this region to generate income and build sustainable tourism products.","output_id":"00087372","output_title":"Via Dinarica Walk"}],"project_descr":"Human development in BiH tackling the most pressing local/rural development challenges for the country","project_id":"00057476","project_title":"Regional Development Programme","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-12-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.4633","lon":"17.118","name":"Banja Luka","outputID":"00071025","output_locID":"00071025-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"41.285","lon":"22.00139","name":"Kavadarci","outputID":"00071025","output_locID":"00071025-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"41.4833","lon":"22.0922","name":"Negotino","outputID":"00077619","output_locID":"00077619-1","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.626","lon":"19.1748","name":"Srebrenica","outputID":"00077619","output_locID":"00077619-2","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.5055","lon":"18.1837","name":"Milici","outputID":"00077620","output_locID":"00077620-1","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"41.4093","lon":"22.2437","name":"Demir Kapija","outputID":"00077620","output_locID":"00077620-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.114","lon":"19.1951","name":"Bratunac","outputID":"00077621","output_locID":"00077621-1","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"41.5","lon":"21.91667","name":"Rosoman","outputID":"00077621","output_locID":"00077621-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00077622","output_locID":"00077622-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00082160","output_locID":"00082160-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00083030","output_locID":"00083030-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00084111","output_locID":"00084111-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00087563","output_locID":"00087563-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00088247","output_locID":"00088247-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00088293","output_locID":"00088293-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00088295","output_locID":"00088295-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.4633","lon":"17.118","name":"Banja Luka","outputID":"00078982","output_locID":"00078982-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00057476","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","outputID":"00087372","output_locID":"00087372-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
