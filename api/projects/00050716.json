Linkages with other monitoring activities  including the 2011 Fragile States Principles Survey  will be made, ensuring useful synergies and cost-effectiveness.\r\nThese workshops will ensure that key partner country stakeholders involved in the management of the Surveys are briefed on the process and technical aspects of the 2011 Surveys, and will offer an opportunity for partner country practitioners to exchange experiences and best practice around the Paris monitoring processes, further strengthening ownership and participation in preparation for the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.
