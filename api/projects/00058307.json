The project will remove systemic, regulatory and knowledge barriers to mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into territorial planning. The objective will be achieved through two outcomes: i) Enabling regulatory, policy and institutional framework for land-use planning that reflects biodiversity considerations outside protected areas, and ii) Tested models for development and enforcement of biodiversity-compatible land-use plans at the district levels.\r\nThe immediate global biodiversity benefits include enhanced ecosystem integrity outside PAs in 10 administrative districts (approximately 2 million hectares). In the long-term, taking into account the sought replication effect, the project will ensure the long-term integrity of fragile ecosystems over 36% of the country.","output_id":"00072384","output_title":"Mainstreaming Biodiversity"}],"project_descr":"Mainstreaming Biodiversity Conservation into Territorial Planning Policies and Practices","project_id":"00058307","project_title":"Mainsteraming Biodiversity","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058307","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"52.1249","lon":"24.2123","name":"Kobryn","outputID":"00072384","output_locID":"00072384-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00058307","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"53.2443","lon":"24.3219","name":"Masty","outputID":"00072384","output_locID":"00072384-2","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00058307","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"53.54","lon":"27.34","name":"Minsk","outputID":"00072384","output_locID":"00072384-3","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00058307","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"55.3719","lon":"27.3741","name":"Miory","outputID":"00072384","output_locID":"00072384-4","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"}]}
