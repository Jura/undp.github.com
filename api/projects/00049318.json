The project will specifically support the joint (GoPNG  Donors) work of the Technical Working Group on Aid Effectiveness by providing it with assistance and technical support. It will build organizational and management/staff capabilities and functions particularly within the GoPNG's aid management entity, and will give initial steps to also build capacities at other Governmental levels. As a knowledge-based project, it will develop several IT instruments to provide the GoPNG with basic managerial capabilities and thus effective ownership over ODA. The Project aims to be instrumental to the process of localization and implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, thus enabling PNG to be more competitive within the global development aid market. \n\nThe Project comprises four broad components: (1) developing the procedures and processes of the APCD; (2) helping develop and/or strengthen relationships between APCD and other DNPRD divisions, other ministries and agencies especially the Department of Treasury, and donors; (3) building human resources through basic skill upgrading, role specific training and on-the-job training; and (4) establishing and using a Grant Management Database as well as other information network improvements.", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [39160.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "Poverty reduction & MDG achievement"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00060067", "output_locID": "00060067-1", "name": "Papua new Guinea", "focus_area": "1", "lat": "-6", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00049318", "lon": "147", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Poverty reduction & MDG achievement"}, {"outputID": "00085577", "output_locID": "00085577-1", "name": "Papua New Guinea", "focus_area": "1", "lat": "-6", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00049318", "lon": "147", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Poverty reduction & MDG achievement"}], "operating_unit": "Papua New Guinea", "budget": 375976.0, "iati_op_id": "PG", "inst_descr": "Department of National Plannin", "start": "2008-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "PNG", "expenditure": 758038.0, "document_name": [["CCPD for Papua New Guinea - narrative and Appendix 1_2.pdf", "00049318_Signed JAWP MPA 2012.pdf", "UNDP_PG_UNDAF%20(2012%20-%202015)"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/PNG/CCPD for Papua New Guinea - narrative and Appendix 1_2.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/PNG/00049318_Signed JAWP MPA 2012.pdf", "http://www.pg.undp.org/content/dam/papua_new_guinea/docs/povred/UNDP_PG_UNDAF (2012 - 2015).pdf"]], "project_id": "00049318", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.pg.undp.org/", "project_title": "aid coordination and management"}
