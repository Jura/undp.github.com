The target is to facilitate the installation of at least 1.75 MW of new decentralized RE power generation capacity during the lifetime of the project, resulting in direct GHG reduction benefits of approximately 35,500 tonnes of CO2eq. Complementary indirect mitigation benefits are expected from the sustained market growth of decentralized RE power generation investments after the project and from paving the way for larger RE power plants  for example, by clarifying the technical and institutional aspects of connecting RE-based intermittent power generation sources into the grid and leveraging financing for RE investments from new sources such as carbon and climate financing. This indirect GHG reduction impact of the project has been estimated to range from 317,000 tonnes to over 1.7 million tonnes of CO2eq depending on the assumptions made.","output_id":"00086064","output_title":"Decentralized Renewable Energy"}],"project_descr":"Small decentralised renewable energy power generation","project_id":"00073116","project_title":"Small Decentralized RE Power Generation","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2014-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00073116","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","outputID":"00086064","output_locID":"00086064-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
