An environmental and recycling culture will be created through volunteering.\r\n\r\nKnowledge, capacities and strategies will be created for the integration of social, poverty and gender variables into the planning processes of the integrated solid waste management at national and local (in Arequipa as pilot) levels.  Synergies between the gradual formalization of recyclers and environmental, social and economic opportunities will be identified and pursued. For many marginalized groups of the population, working in the solid waste sector represents an adaptive answer to avoid extreme poverty. The transformation towards a social inclusive and integrated waste system, promoting pro-poor opportunities in the recycling market, facilitates the creation of high quality jobs. Furthermore, the establishment of a sustained process of capacity-building of poor and vulnerable recyclers, both women and men, will lead to their integration in a more sustainable and competitive recycling market, while at the same time improving their wellbeing. The empowerment of women recyclers is a special focus of interest within the project, strengthening their capacity, promoting their leadership in the solid waste management, and creating conditions to ensure their participation in decision-making about their livelihoods. Special attention will be given to replication opportunities in other regions and at national level. With the contribution of United Nations Volunteers, the project will promote an environmental friendly and segregation culture through a local volunteering approach and citizen participation with a gender perspective.  \r\nThe 5 principal results of the project are:\r\n1.\tStrengthened institutional capacity of the Ministry of the Environment through the integration of social, poverty and gender variables into the solid waste management system of Peru;  \r\n2.\tStrengthened institutional capacity of the Provincial Municipality of Arequipa to improve the integrated management of solid waste through the incorporation of social, poverty and gender variables in local policies, instruments and tools.  \r\n3.\tStrengthened recyclers associations and favorable conditions towards long term financial sustainability;  \r\n4.\tThe population of Arequipa mobilized and a waste-friendly and recycling culture generated through volunteering.\r\n5.\tProject management and the experiences of the project have been systematized and replication opportunities have been promoted.","output_id":"00088355","output_title":"PEI Peru"},{"award_id":"00075132","budget":[226554.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00041"],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":["UNEP"],"expenditure":[63934.0],"fiscal_year":["2014"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"PEI Mozambique","output_id":"00088620","output_title":"PEI - Mozambique"},{"award_id":"00075132","budget":[225300.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00041"],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":["UNEP"],"expenditure":[0.0],"fiscal_year":["2014"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"PEI Mali","output_id":"00088621","output_title":"PEI - Mali"}],"project_descr":"The joint UNDP- UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) is a global programme that supports country-led efforts to mainstream P-E linkages into national development policy, planning and budgeting processes.","project_id":"00075132","project_title":"Joint UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative -Phase II","region_id":"global","start":"2013-07-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00075132","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00087206","output_locID":"00087206-1","precision":"","type":""}]}
