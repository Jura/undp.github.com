The scope of the global programme aims to allow the organisation to deliver its results in basic social services, in accordance with the individual requirements of programme countries and partner organisations, by establishing a results and resources framework to guide country-specific initiatives as well as a mechanism to fund proposals in support of national, regional and global efforts and UN engagement in basic social services. \r\n\r\nBeyond mobilising the necessary expertise to develop the global programme document, the Initiation Plan will support activities identified as necessary to prepare the implementation of the programme, such as (i) a desk review of UNV's previous and current work in basic social services, and of policies of key agencies and organisations in this sector, (ii) consolidation of partnerships with relevant UN entities, governments and CSOs, including identification of key partners and priority countries/regions of engagement; (iii) finalisation of the programme document, including the preparation of programme management materials and tools, and anticipated future UN Volunteer expertise.","output_id":"00089132","output_title":"Basic Social Services"}],"project_descr":"This Initiation Plan aims to develop UNV's global Basic Social Services Programme, which will be implemented in a number of countries/(sub-)regions that will be identified during UNV's Strategic Framework period.","project_id":"00078998","project_title":"Initiation Plan Basic Social Services Programme","region_id":"global","start":"2014-01-01","subnational":[]}
