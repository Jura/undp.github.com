The project will focus specifically on three themes that involve one or more of these responsibilities; strengthening parliament's role in the budget process; supporting parliament's work in the area of local self-government, and strengthening technical support to committees and factions. The budget process element will work towards implementation of a parliamentary budget cycle in which parliament participates in providing opportunities for public input to government budget planning, expands its analysis of the budget document, and exercises oversight of budget execution in conjunction with the Chamber of Control. Support to parliament's work on local self-government will include expanded opportunities for public policy dialogue, and support to policy and legislation development. The technical support element will assist parliament in assessing committee staff support needs and organizing training and reorganization as needed. The project is structured around a partnership between the Georgian parliament and the Eastern European, Baltic and Nordic parliaments; including GUAM countries and those with a similar history to Georgia but now members of the European Union, and countries that are longstanding advanced democracy. The partnerships will provide access to expertise and capacity-development opportunities for both parliamentarians and staff.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "NLEVD"], "expenditure": [121656.0, 311199.0, 260494.0, 330068.0], "crs_descr": "Elections", "focus_area_descr": "South-South"}, {"output_id": "00087093", "crs": "15161", "donor_id": ["00012"], "focus_area": "8", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "Project Initiation", "budget": [1.0], "fiscal_year": [2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["Voluntary Contributions"], "award_id": "00057935", "output_descr": null, "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [1943.0], "crs_descr": "Elections", "focus_area_descr": "South-South"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00071754", "output_locID": "00071754-1", "name": "Kutaisi", "focus_area": "8", "lat": "42.24961", "type": "PPLA", "awardID": "00057935", "lon": "42.69974", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "South-South"}, {"outputID": "00071754", "output_locID": "00071754-2", "name": "Tbilisi", "focus_area": "8", "lat": "41.69411", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00057935", "lon": "44.83368", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "South-South"}, {"outputID": "00087093", "output_locID": "00087093-1", "name": "City of Tbilisi", "focus_area": "8", "lat": "41.69411", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00057935", "lon": "44.83368", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "South-South"}], "operating_unit": "Georgia", "budget": 2683263.0, "iati_op_id": "GE", "inst_descr": "GOVERNMENT", "start": "2009-08-01", "operating_unit_id": "GEO", "expenditure": 1959786.0, "document_name": [["00057935_Parliament Prodoc Signed Feb 2010"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GEO/00057935_Parliament Prodoc Signed Feb 2010.pdf"], ["pdf"]], "project_id": "00057935", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.ge.undp.org/", "project_title": "strong parliament in a consolidated democracy"}
