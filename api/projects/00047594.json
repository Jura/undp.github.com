Through a coordinated interagency collaboration, this project proposal will provide an expedited mechanism for development, submission and approval of countries' proposals (individual funding requests of up to $20,000 benefitting 90 countries) for their 2010 Biodiversity Targets National Assessments. Activities at country level will include data gathering, stakeholder consultations and reporting / communicating. Guidance and knowledge material will be made available. A website for information exchange and network on the theme will be developed and constantly updated, permitting also on-line status reporting in real-time to the CBD, the GEF, countries, interested partners, organizations and individuals. Furthermore, the project will offer countries the possibility of having their report reviewed for technical standards, completeness and consistency.\n\nAt global level, this project will link up to, complement and build upon the progress and results of the following initiatives: (1) UNEP's BIP2010 Global Project (\"Building the Partnership to Track Progress at the Global Level in Achieving the 2010 Biodiversity Target, Phase 1\"); (2) The UNDP supported Millennium Development Project; and (3) Convention on Biological Diversity's efforts both towards the completion of countries' Fourth National Report to the CBD before the deadline of March 30th 2009 and in the preparation of the third edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook and its byproducts.
