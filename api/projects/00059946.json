The project will further strengthen the dialogue, information exchange and cooperation among all the relevant stakeholders including governmental, non-governmental, academic, and private sectors. It is expected that this will result in achieving national consensus on the actions and measures that need to be undertaken to address the climate change related issues relevant for the country on a short and long term.
