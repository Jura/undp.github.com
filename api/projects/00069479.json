The project aims at developing a Full Sised Project on \"implementing urgent adaptation priorities through decentralised and national development plans\". It addresses three of the five NAPA priorities i.e. implementing community resilience to climate change through the development of sustainable rural livelihoods (priority 1), improving agricultural production under erratic rains and changing climate conditions (priority 4), and improving alawi's preparedness to cope with droughts and floods. The project will demonstrate how climate change adaptation can be mainstreamed into economic governance approaches for meaningful capacity development of district and central govenment planners, how climate resilience can be integrated into current spending plans and budgets  to ensure that domestic resources implement urgent and immediate adaptation needs.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [0.0, 47972.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00084036", "output_locID": "00084036-1", "name": "Malawi", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-13.5", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00069479", "lon": "34", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Malawi", "budget": 109000.0, "iati_op_id": "MW", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2012-09-30", "operating_unit_id": "MWI", "expenditure": 47972.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00069479", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.mw/", "project_title": "implementing urgent adaptation priorities"}
