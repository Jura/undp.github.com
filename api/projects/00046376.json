All these actions will have a special emphasis on access to the Internet at central, provincial and district levels.\r\n \r\nThis expansion in access will lead to the growth of Electronic Government and in particular, citizens and the private sector will benefit from increased access to public services, as well as in facilitating their participation in the governance of the country through e-Participation, e-Democracy, and e-Administration. The government's electronic network (GovNet), government portals at central and provincial levels, the Provincial Digital Resource Centres (CPRDs) and the Multi-media Community Centres are important support through which these actions will be implemented. \r\n\r\nSome activities that were initially planned for 2009 but were however not carried out due to budgetary restrictions, have been reformulated and figure again among the activities for 2010. Some of the outstanding activities include the use of ICTs to strengthen the availability of information about Mozambique, a survey on the state of ICTs in the public sector, implementation of the Electronic Government strategy and training for state employees in the ICT area.\r\n\r\nThe UTICT will make an effort during 2010 to ensure financial sustainability as well as that of the CPRDs and CMCs by 1) guaranteeing close links between these bodies and 2) ensuring that allocation of the project's financial resources are directed more towards project activities rather than to other purposes.  \r\n\r\nThe support to UTICT project intends to attain its main goal through the following outcomes:\r\n1.1.6\tSupport given for making the Electronic Government Strategy operational.\r\n2.1.6\tManagement of Information Communication Technologies in selected provinces, districts and municipalities strengthened and responsibilities of the partners in implementing the GovNet strategy redefined.", "donor_short": [], "donor_name": ["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Mozambique", "budget": 609827.0, "iati_op_id": "MZ", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2007-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "MOZ", "expenditure": 552177.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00046376", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "development planning, coordination and m & e"}
