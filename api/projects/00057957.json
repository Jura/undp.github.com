Populations of many globally threatened species are still found here, from snow leopard and lynx to the highly endangered Woolly Flying Squirrel. Although protected areas now cover some 11% of the mountains, and community co-managed conservancies a further 12%, threats remain to the region's unique biodiversity, due to poverty and limited options for sustainable sources of livelihood. The project will use voluntary certification of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) as a tool to promote biodiversity conservation and strengthen existing conservation efforts with innovative market-based mechanisms. The project will develop community and institutional capacity for certified production of 'biodiversity-friendly' NTFPs in northern Pakistan and stimulate market demand for biodiversity friendly NTFP thereby creating new economic incentives for conservation.", "donor_short": [], "donor_name": ["Global Environment Fund Trustee", "UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"], "expense": [21564.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Pakistan", "fiscal_year": [2011], "inst_id": "", "project_descr": "Stimulate market demand for biodiversity friendly Non-Timber Forest Products", "operating_unit_id": "PAK", "expenditure": 21564.0, "iati_op_id": "PK", "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/PAK/00057957/Mountain and Market ProDOC.pdf"], [""], [8]], "project_id": "00057957", "disbursement": 0.0, "end": "2011-12-31", "project_title": "mountain & markets project", "subnational": [], "budget": 25526.0, "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2009-08-01", "operating_unit_website": "http://undp.org.pk/", "expense": 21564.0, "inst_type_id": "10"}
