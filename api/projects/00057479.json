UNDP has a key role in providing capacity development to promote managing for development results, and the project therefore integrates a component which looks at making aid more effective and developing capacity for development results. Middle Income Countries in LAC require a tailored approach to capacity development which takes into consideration their unique needs and potential to join the international donor and aid communities.  By adapting the CD and Aid Effectiveness toolkit to specific MIC needs, in concert with Project 00056668, CD LAC will facilitate the implementation and interexchange of South-South initiatives.  CD LAC has begun this process through the development of a strategic document on South-South cooperation.\r\nAdditionally, CD LAC will provide policy advice on the implementation of effective aid coordination and aid management according to national and international standards (including the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action). CD tools are adaptable to specific needs, assist in the formulation of CD Responses and provide support to boost aid-effectiveness.","output_id":"00071032","output_title":"Capacity Development & Aid Eff"},{"award_id":"00057479","budget":[21400.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[21400.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"(2012) This project was closed in the 3rd Substantial Revision submitted on December 15, 2011 and approved on December 30, 2011.\r\n\r\n(2009) Local basic service delivery remains a major challenge in the LAC region. Besides the fact that most of the LAC countries are considered Middle Income Countries (MIC), inequality and equal access to quality basic services and social exclusion remain a real issue and have a direct impact in widening the poverty gap between rich and poor. In a context where population needs are increasing and where structural phenomena follow one another in an intermittent way, the capacity of public institutions still remains insufficient and inefficient in addressing local basic service delivery. Though decentralization programmes have been taking place in most countries in the region, local authorities still have to deal with a serious limited capacities (institutional, human, financial) to face their service delivery responsibilities through innovative approaches.\r\nIn this sense, the LAC region is also characterized by the progressive emergence of multiple types of Non State Actors (NSA) and other private organizations (formal and informal) that tend to find a sustainable alternative to national and regional challenges. In many countries the alliance of these actors with public authorities at the local and national level has been proved to be an effective way to meet social needs, through the establishment of effective local level public-private partnerships (PPP) for service delivery. \r\nThe CD LAC will then provide support to the creation and consolidation of these multi-stakeholder alliances for the implementation of downstream public service delivery models (pro-poor PPP) at the local level. By supporting CD for the mobilization of local private sector and other Non State Actors and establishing dialogue between public, private and the community and users of services, the CD LAC programme, in coordination with the country offices, will provide governments with a menu of alternative local service delivery approaches to choose from, based on local needs and context.","output_id":"00071033","output_title":"Capacity Dev & Local Service D"}],"project_descr":"Strenghthening national  to reduce inequalities and meet the MDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean","project_id":"00057479","project_title":"Strengthening capacities in LAC","region_id":"global","start":"2009-05-20","subnational":[{"awardID":"00057479","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00071030","output_locID":"00071030-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057479","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00071031","output_locID":"00071031-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
