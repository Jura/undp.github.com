UNDP has a key role in providing capacity development to promote managing for development results, and the project therefore integrates a component which looks at making aid more effective and developing capacity for development results. Middle Income Countries in LAC require a tailored approach to capacity development which takes into consideration their unique needs and potential to join the international donor and aid communities.  By adapting the CD and Aid Effectiveness toolkit to specific MIC needs, in concert with Project 00056668, CD LAC will facilitate the implementation and interexchange of South-South initiatives.  CD LAC has begun this process through the development of a strategic document on South-South cooperation.\r\nAdditionally, CD LAC will provide policy advice on the implementation of effective aid coordination and aid management according to national and international standards (including the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action). CD tools are adaptable to specific needs, assist in the formulation of CD Responses and provide support to boost aid-effectiveness.", "donor_short": [], "donor_name": ["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00071030", "output_locID": "00071030-1", "name": "Republic of Panama", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "9.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00057479", "lon": "-80.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"outputID": "00071031", "output_locID": "00071031-1", "name": "Republic of Panama", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "9.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00057479", "lon": "-80.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"outputID": "00071033", "output_locID": "00071033-1", "name": "Republic of Panama", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "9.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00057479", "lon": "-80.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Panama Regional Center", "budget": 254577.0, "iati_op_id": "998", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2009-05-20", "operating_unit_id": "R46", "expenditure": 256599.0, "document_name": [["00057479_00057479 Anexo PRODOC CD original", "00057479_00057479 Capacity Development  Request for Extension", "00057479_00057479 revision sustantiva 2012 final"], ["https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/R46/00057479_00057479 Anexo PRODOC CD original.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/R46/00057479_00057479 Capacity Development - Request for Extension.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/R46/00057479_00057479 revision sustantiva 2012 final.pdf"], ["pdf", "pdf", "pdf"], [0, 7, 3]], "project_id": "00057479", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "strengthening capacities in lac"}
