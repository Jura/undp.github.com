The PPG will also support coordination between this initiative and Montreal Protocol activities to ensure that the project design maximizes the potential of reducing refrigerant greenhouse gas emissions. The project preparation phase will also fully integrate the GEF investment component to Ecuador's Renova program to ensure that the GEF funds enhance the implementation of this program.  Finally, since as the proposed project engages a wide variety of public and private institutions and stakeholders, the PPG will support the involvement of these actors in the project design through a participative logframe analysis, as well as developing a stakeholder participation plan for project implementation.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [14931.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00085822", "output_locID": "00085822-1", "name": "Ecuador", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "-2", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00072777", "lon": "-77.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Ecuador", "budget": 28457.0, "iati_op_id": "EC", "inst_descr": "UNDP DEX PROYECTS", "start": "2013-03-01", "operating_unit_id": "ECU", "expenditure": 14931.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00072777", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.pnud.org.ec/", "project_title": "securing energy efficiency"}
