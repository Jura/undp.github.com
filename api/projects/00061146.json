Under this output 130 thermal heating systems primarily burning straw will be installed totalling about 35 MWth (average installed capacity of approx. 300 kWth) for the provision of heating for public buildings in rural communities in Moldova. Supporting this, market mechanisms will be used to support the involvement of local fuel suppliers to prepare, store and supply the fuel needed for the installed heating plants.
