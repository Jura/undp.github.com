In 2008, UNDP/PAPP in coordination with Ministry of Local Governance, Association of Palestinian Local Authorities, and selected Local Government Units (LGUs), namely municipalities, developed a local governance integrity index to assess municipalities' performance. This project aims at applying the LG integrity index on 134 municipalities, identify performance deficiencies,  develop capacities of Ministry of Local Governance and municipalities in applying the index, developing and  implementing reform action plans to improve municipalities' performance. More specifically, the project aims to induce an enabling environment for promoting transparency and accountability at the local level, based on the principles of accountability, transparency, and active community participation.\nAs part of the LGSP, the project will significantly contribute to other LGSP components by promoting transparency and accountability that is necessary to efficiently manage local revenues  and is expected to encourage the central government in decentralizing other assigned revenues for municipalities that are currently managed by the central government.
