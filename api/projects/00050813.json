One of the key requirements for the achievement of the financial sustainability of the water utility companies is to implement economically-based tariffs, i.e. higher water prices. However, in recognition that such measures place a disproportionately greater burden on vulnerable groups, offsetting social mitigation measures (subsidies) will be required. The input received from the engagement of citizens' groups in the proposed participatory processes will improve municipalities' ability to target these vulnerable groups, and thereby improve the effectiveness of the social mitigation measures while reducing costs. Furthermore, including citizens' representatives in the process offers an opportunity to educate the citizenry about the importance of the proposed tariff restructuring, thereby increasing support for such measures at the grassroots level and improving the likelihood of acceptance.", "donor_short": ["SIDA", "UNDP(JPAA)"], "expenditure": [2565647.0, 1340225.0, 889808.0, 196385.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00079821", "output_locID": "00079821-1", "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "focus_area": "1", "lat": "44.250000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00050813", "lon": "17.833330", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Inclusive & Sustainable Growth"}, {"outputID": "00062932", "output_locID": "00062932-1", "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "44.15", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00050813", "lon": "17.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "budget": 3004535.0, "iati_op_id": "BA", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2008-09-09", "operating_unit_id": "BIH", "expenditure": 5322426.0, "document_name": [["00050813_MDGF BiH EG JPD Signed Cover Page ENG", "00050813_MDGF EG JPD FINAL 16 12 08", "ProDoc_GoAL Wash WATSAN Regulatory Framework in BH", "GW_ProDoc_scan_first_page", "Bosnia and Herzegovina DoA 30 May 2013", "GW BIH 2014_AnnualReport", "ProgressReport_jan-apr_2014", "ProgressReport_may-aug_2014", "Purchase Order Summary", "CPAPPlan2010_2014", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development", "Democratic Green Economic Development"], ["https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/00050813_MDG-F BiH EG JPD Signed Cover Page ENG.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/00050813_MDG-F EG JPD FINAL 16 12 08.doc", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/ProDoc_GoAL Wash WATSAN Regulatory Framework in BH.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/GW_ProDoc_scan_first_page.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/Bosnia and Herzegovina DoA 30 May 2013.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/GW BIH 2014_AnnualReport.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/ProgressReport_jan-apr_2014.pdf", "https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BIH/ProgressReport_may-aug_2014.pdf", "http://open.undp.org/#project/00050813", "http://www.ba.undp.org/content/dam/bosnia_and_herzegovina/docs/Lega_lFramework/CPAPPlan2010_2014.pdf", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=27449", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=27664", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=28058", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=28338", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=21288", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=21232", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=20985", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=21868", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=24124", "http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=24180"], ["pdf", "doc", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 9, 7, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]], "project_id": "00050813", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "democratic green economic development"}
