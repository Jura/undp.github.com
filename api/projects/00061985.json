Map and assess existing and potential linkages between climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR)\n\n1. List the policies, tools and mechanisms already in place linking CCA and DRR and at national or local level.                                                                                                                                                                                                 2. Identify the national and local institutions that are already mandated to work in the fields of CCA and DRR.\n3. List relevant units with key stakeholders as well as unit staff's previous experiences. Break down in particular the capacity on CCA and DRR within the Jordan Civil Defense and the Ministry of Environment respectively, and list any coordination mechanisms in place.\n4. Assess incentives and barriers already in place to integrate the fields of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, i.e. through the identified policies, tools and mechanisms defined in activity A.1. (see above). This assessment shall include and give special attention to the following issues:\na. Generation of climate and hazard information.\nb. Communication of risks and planning tools.\nc. Coordination mechanisms.\nd. Political momentum and institutional capacity-building.\ne. Grassroots/local capacity and community involvement.\nf. Financing adaptation.\n5. Describe possible synergies, overlaps and gaps in the mandate of the institutions identified in activity A.2. (see above) as well as in the identified policies, tools and mechanisms related to CCA and DRR.\n6. Examine the extent to which current disaster risk management practices reflect future adaptation needs and assess what changes of practices may be required to address future risks.\n\nB. Assist the Government of Jordan to design a Framework for Action and a detailed three-year Action Plan to promote potential linkages between current efforts to promote climate change adaptation and current disaster risk management efforts with the objective of increasing natural and human resilience\n\n1. Lead a participatory process to design a Framework for Action and 3-year Action Plan that ensures ownership by all involved institutions, in particular the institutions identified under the above-mentioned activity A.2.\n2. Ensure that the Framework for Action and the Action Plan include an assessment of adverse effects of climate-related disasters on human resilience, notably poverty reduction, in Jordan.\n3. Ensure that the Framework for Action includes a set of recommendations on how to strengthen human resilience, notably poverty reduction interventions, to climate change and climate-related disasters in Jordan.\n4. Identify the responsible institution(s) at national level for implementation of each activity in the action plan, and include clear coordination mechanisms.\n5. Identify capacity development needs for each of the identified institutions to carry out their responsibilities.\n6. Develop a timeline and budget for the 3-year Action Plan.\n7. Recommend components (actions, priorities, mechanisms) of the Framework for inclusion in the revision of the Jordan National Agenda.\n8. Advocate for the inclusion of these recommendations in the Jordan National Agenda.\n\nC. Identify and develop a project proposal to be supported by UNDP\n\n1. Identify how the Framework for Action and Action Plan can be integrated into UNDP Jordan's ongoing programme of support.\n2. Identify geographical areas where potential linkages between DRR and CCA can be clearly addressed within the scope of one or more UNDP-supported projects.\n3. Develop  using the UNDP format for project design  a draft project document incorporating priorities and activities identified and agreed upon with national stakeholders in the newly established Framework for Action and Action Plan. The project design shall include a results and resource framework identifying implementing partners; outcomes; outputs; activities; baseline indicators; technical expertise and other input required; risks  including sustainability  and suggested mitigation measures; and timeframe.", "donor_short": ["DDC"], "expenditure": [46434.0, 7020.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}, {"output_id": "00080351", "crs": "41010", "donor_id": ["00140", "00852"], "focus_area": "5", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "Building ASEZA DRR Capacity", "budget": [6600.0, 77350.0, 285286.0], "fiscal_year": [2011, 2012, 2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN", "IVC-SWISS AGENCY FOR DEVELOPME"], "award_id": "00061985", "output_descr": "The project aims to build the capacity to mitigate and respond to disasters in Aqaba through the following:\n\nA.
