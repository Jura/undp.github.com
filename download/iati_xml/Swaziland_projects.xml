3. The Mainstreaming of CC Risks into National Policies Report was produced. UNDP supported the reengineering for high-level engagement by the country in the transboundary and national water resources management. The Position Paper for the Swaziland Tripartite Partnership Technical Committee (TPTC) was produced, which instrument was enabled by the Climate Change Impacts Assessment Transboundary Water Resources Management Report bringing recommendations for presentation in the next sitting of the TPTC (South Africa and Mozambique) for CCA integrated policy reform.


4. Advocacy and awareness creation on climate change adaptation (CCA) and its linkages with sustainable development was demonstrated during the 2015 World Water Day. Awareness for rural communities for adoption of practices through water harvesting was promoted for example the sand dams supply to the local clinic was demonstrated at KaBhudla community. Further demonstration were on the sand dams supplying water for vegetable growing through the climate smart agriculture drip irrigation technology.</narrative>

              <narrative>The key outputs of this activity were mostly achieved in the 2014/15 reporting period.


During this reporting period, the Project has facilitated greater integration of the water sector issues in the work of the National Climate Change Committee and further develop plans to incorporate climate change in a sector wide approach. 


The project has strengthened the coordination and inclusion of climate change into the sector wide approach within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy.


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy has further established a coordinated reporting system for which climate change is one of the key pillars feeding into the National Planning and Reporting Processes and frameworks in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy.</narrative>

              <narrative>The key baseline studies and knowledge gaps on climate change impacts for the water sector were conducted and completed during the 2013/14 reporting period. The Third National Communications to the UNFCCC for Swaziland supported by UNEP analytic base has already benefitted from the 2014 CC Vulnerability Assessment Report facilitated by the Project. Information packaging is currently underway through the development of abridged versions and new products for different users in particular, decision makers, the various technical institutions, vulnerable community members and women. These will be shared with stakeholders in various platforms such as meetings, public offices, electronically and through the webpage. The products include:

	Summarized versions of all the key project reports (the vulnerability assessment, crop diversification study, groundwater study and policy and institutional dialogues report)

	Project Policy brief report based on report outcomes.

	Lessons learnt report

	Technical Knowledge sharing products in both English and local language (Siswati): through pamphlets, brochures for sand dams, rainwater harvesting and ecosystem restoration

	Development of a video on sand dams construction, maintenance and use. 

	Development of a scientific paper on sand dams technology for information sharing with the academia and other partners.

This will increase the visibility of the project and spread the successful story of the project impacts. The Outputs will also be shared in both the UNDP website and the Government (DWA) new project website currently being developed. The targeted institutions include: KOBWA, MNRE, MoA, MoEPD, MoF, MoH, MoPSI, MTEA, NCCC, NDMA, NMS, NWA, RBAs, SEA, SWADE, SZWP, TPTC). Some of the products will target other stakeholders like communities and local traditional leaders.</narrative>

              <narrative>1.2.1 - The project has facilitated climate change issues in the water sector in overall. The climate change response measures that were identified in a participatory manner involving all key stakeholders culminated into the drafting of policy statements for inclusion in the water sector related policies. The scientific evidence and outputs of the project vulnerability assessments were used as a reference point in the formulation of the following policies:

	Final draft of the Climate Change Policy developed in 2014.

	Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2014-2018 incorporating adaptation measures for the water sector completed in 2013/14.

Policy statements on climate change adaptation for inclusion in the following water sector strategic documents were developed: 2003 National Water Policy and the IWRM Master Plan. These statement briefs are utilized by the DWA in a review process for integration of climate change through an EU funded project. The Emergency Preparedness Plans for the major dams in Swaziland Reports were produced .These are currently being utilized by the DWA to inform the new country Dam Safety Regulations that are under formulation. The project outputs have also been instrumental in informing the drafting of the Third National Communication to the UNFCCC and the Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs) Report to be submitted to UN in October. The PMU serves in the technical working group to facilitate supply of climate change adaptation and mitigation information for the water sector.</narrative>

              <narrative>2.1.1 - 2.1.3 The final guidelines for mainstreaming climate change and toolkits for practical implementation of climate for the water and land use sector were developed and finalised in collaboration with the key stakeholders. Recommendations for Policy statements for climate change mainstreaming were developed for inclusion into the following national policies:

	Water sector policies (IWRM Master Plan, National Water Policy

	National Land Policy

	Review of the Environment Impact Assessment Regulatory Framework

	Comprehensive Agricultural Sector Policy


In addition, various tools for practical application of climate change response measures for water and land use were developed. The tools included: Digital agriculture &amp; amp; Land use Toolkit – Version 1.0 – December 2014; The Climate Mapper; CRISTAL; Climate Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis Tool (cvca); Climate Change  Monitoring Tool; WEAP; Mike Basin; SCADA; and,Standard Precipitation Index 40. Upon validation of the reports, stakeholders were engaged in a training on the practical use of these tools to foster understanding and technical skilling.</narrative>

              <narrative>Increased resilience for the sugar industry, which accounts for a significant proportion of the GDP (18-21% of the GDP) has been climate-proofed.  The project has successfully identified specific climate change risks and tailor made response measures for the three major investments in Swaziland through the development of Emergency Preparedness Plans (drought and floods) for the three major dam infrastructures in Swaziland; Maguga, Mjoli and Lubovane Dams for KOBWA, Komati Downstream Development Project (KDDP) and the LUSIP project, respectively.

The intervention aimed at building the capacities for risk management with focus on improving the technical staff and downstream communities’ awareness on the future anticipated impacts of climate change. This has culminated into the development of Dam Safety Regulations for the major Dams operated by the three institutions, highlighted above.

Through the project interventions, climate change tailor made response measures were recommended for the two SWADE projects (LUSIP and KDDP) and also for the LUSIP-GEF project community Development Plans. A number of climate change recommendations for each investment plan was identified for implementation by SWADE and other key stakeholders. These recommendations were discussed with senior management of SWADE in order to develop an action plan to address a responsive undertaking towards mitigating potential impacts. The commitment demonstrated by SWADE to address the recommendations was evident in translating lessons into the development of the chiefdom development plans and environment mitigation plans.</narrative>

              <narrative>Fifteen (15) new climate change adaptation modules were developed under Output 2.2. About 13 of the modules are dealing with agricultural extension and agribusiness, incorporating climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices and new agronomic practices in the light of climate change. The modules also focus on the key cash crops that are produced in the country in light of the diversification options: Cassava, vegetables etc.  Some of the modules focused on IWRM management and improving irrigation efficiency at the farm level as well as rainwater harvesting in and outside the farm. An environmental module was also developed focusing on the environmental aspects in the project. 


A consultative approach was utilised in the development of the climate smart modules  to be utilised through a Training of Trainers modality, however some modules would have to facilitate a contact modality, in particular training of the farmers. Thirty-five (35) SWADE Trainers, composed of community environmental officers and SWADE agricultural extension officers were trained on the modules which was also open for the communities' lead farmers. The trainings were not only limited to the modules but also covered the aspects of revised chiefdom development plans guidelines taking into account climate change impacts.</narrative>

              <narrative>2.4.1/2: The impacts of the rainwater harvesting systems installed in schools and communities were monitored during the reporting period together with the lessons documentation. The activities also included training in six (6) schools for teachers, students, school committees, constituency leaders, community health motivators, community water management committees and traditional community leaders. In total there were 256 trained people of which 58% were women. The training did not only focus on rainwater harvesting but also considered an integrated approach to environmental and natural resources management. Knowledge sharing  and good practice was instilled among the school children through establishment of schools water, sanitation and environmental groups to champion the management of the harvested water and productive use of excess and waste water through fruit tree growing (the trees were also provided by the project) 

Key impacts that are monitored include:  improvement on sanitation issues (diahorreal reports at neighboring clinics), absenteeism’s due to water related challenges, and this will also be included in the lessons learnt documentation under development.


2.4.3/5: The community capacities for ecosystem restoration continue being enabled on the ground. The activities achieved and completed so far include: Integrated approach to removal of Alien invasive plans covering an area more than 50ha; Artificial means to improve rainwater infiltration through trenching and terracing; Establishment of livelihood projects that are climate smart and less dependent on natural resources such as, establishment of vegetable nursery, fruit tree plantation integrated with bee keeping, and; 5ha drip irrigation and fish production.

Ownership of the intervention continues being embedded in community participation. Partnership with other institutions such as the National Agricultural Marketing Board (NAMBoard) has been established to provide sustainable extension and marketing services to the community schemes as well as Ministry of Agriculture extension department and non-government organization - World Vision for continued providing of support to the community.  The project is also providing continuous training in leadership to foster sustainability, in particular for the participating women.</narrative>

              <narrative>2.4.6  -The installation of the automated weather stations at the two project sites (LUSIP 1 and KDDP) was completed 2013/14. The purpose of the stations was to expand the data availability to farmers can use for planning for climate change and also provide data for early warning systems. The collected data has been linked to National Grid at the National Meteorological Service (MET) and has contributed to the expansion of the national weather stations network. The stations have generated reliable climate and weather data for the past two years, increasing MET's capacity to provide consistent meteorological services to its users in particular as the country intends to conduct modelling scenarios. The stations have also been coded and linked with the South African Weather stations and these are known as (Sihhoye and Lubovane Weather Stations). The Data that is obtained from these stations include: Temperature, Sunshine, Relative humidity, Pressure, Rainfall, Wind speed and direction and evaporation data. All the data is automated except for the evaporation data. A data backup system has also been upgraded by the project at the National Meteorological Service through the mobile network, making it easier and more cost-effective to collect and monitor inconsistences. The MET technicians have been trained on the system and linked to the South African Weather Service for continuous support and maintenance of the stations. The Government of Swaziland has also set aside a budget for the continuous maintenance of the system. In addition to the installed instruments, the project provided additional spare parts tools that can run the system for the next 5 years.


2.4.7 The development of curriculum for schools has been left as a prerogative of the National Meteorological Office which is responsible for climate change coordination at National Level. The Project Board and Technical Committee recommended that this activity be led by the NMS and the project provide the resources.  The MTR recommended that if the NMS is not able to utilize the funds by year end, the resources will be re-allocated to another activity. The Project however has continued to lobby the NMS to conduct the activity. The National Curriculum Centre provisionally agreed to engage on this activity and the process is at its infancy.</narrative>

              <narrative>2.4.2 - The project has successfully piloted 5 sand dams across the driest areas in the Lowveld of Swaziland. The two outstanding Dams at Sitilo and Sigwe were completed during the reporting period. The total estimated beneficiaries are 6,711 of which 52% are women. The sand dams have been very key in highlighting CCA in the country. Close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and Department of Water Affairs (DWA) as well as with the five communities that participated and contributed towards their establishment in both monetary contributions and providing labor. The existing collaboration of the MOA and DWA has yielded positively on the impact even at political levels. The Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Natural Resources and Energy have officially embraced this technology through an official opening during the 2015 World Water Day Commemoration event that was held at the Mafutseni (for the KaBhudla Sand Dam) where there was demonstrated linkages between the water and health sectors. The sand dams has facilitated water supply to the newly constructed KaBhudla Clinic. The DWA is continuing to provide the necessary monitoring of the water quality through laboratory analysis of the water and also monitoring the water quantity.  The communities are being assisted to put up a proposal for Government to fund pumping of the water from the dams and provide it for both establishment drip irrigated gardens and for potable water supply to the various surrounding communities.

The lessons learnt and full scale impact including a gender analysis report is still being conducted for future reporting.</narrative>

A consensus has been reached that this component is very essential both within the country and at the transboundary level. The project has facilitated the engagement of both local and international consultants to assist in developing the position and strategy paper informing the delegation to the TPTC. A model for water and demand management is currently being established for the three major basins (Komati, Mbuluzi and Usuthu). Data collection is underway among the various entities and institutions. The inception phase of the study has been completed. The team of consultants are currently working on the modelling of various climate change scenarios that will inform the position of the country and further inform the strategy that will focus the country on CCA IWRM, as well as conducting stakeholder’s consultation at various levels including the transboundary levels. The final outputs are expected in October 2015, upon which the engagement of the riparian countries to discuss the outcome will be solicited. The process has received political support from the Minister of Natural Resources and Energy. The capacity of the TPTC negotiating team will also be built through training through utilization of the project outputs like the climate change vulnerability assessment for the water sector and infrastructure.</narrative>

              <narrative>1. Extensive advocacy consultation brought more awareness on conservation management through Protected Areas by the traditional leaders in all the four (4) Regions of the country. 26 Chiefdoms with 409 community members and 13 private land owners identified biodiversity management initiatives that can contribute to job creation, were consulted on the GEF-funded SNPAS Project. The SNPAS Project Management Unit comprising of 9 staff members was established together with the Project Steering Committee and the Project Board, structures that will promote the uptake of systemic conservation management in the country.

2. Evidence generation for conservation management through the Knowledge-based GIS biodiversity System for the country was initiated. Technical support was engaged and drafted inception reports on how the work for the integrated biodiversity and sustainable financing, legal and land-use assessments would be facilitated by rural communities in 2016/2017.</narrative>
