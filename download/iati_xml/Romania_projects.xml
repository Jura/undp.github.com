              <narrative>Due to the successful partnership with the local authorities and popularity of this pilot programme on the application of sustainable heating systems in selected social buildings, during this reporting period one more central heating unit installment has been finalized in Calan Municipality ("City Hall B unit"), with a calculated saving of 33,25 Mwh/year in heat energy and 24,19 tonnes CO2 equiv and 5 central heating units are in the process to be installed, 2 in Petrila Municipality and 3 given as prizes within the framework of a contest ‚ÄúEnergy Efficiency Begins with Local Communities‚Äù organized within the project aiming to involve as many communities in the pilot areas (Dolj and Hunedoara counties) of the project and aimed to reward the efforts of local authorities on energy efficiency measures and use of energy from renewable resources. The prizes for the local administrations ranked in the top three consisted in the provision and installation of a sustainable heating system for an institution (school, nursery, home for the elderly, etc.) in their respective municipalities: Vulcan, Galicea Mare and Brad Local Municipalities. The installment of the above mentioned 5 central heating units will be finalized and energy savings will be calculated within the next reporting period. In addition the project is able to report indirect energy savings through the activities carried on under the National Rehabilitation Programme, as follows: a number of 73 blocks, 3521 apartments have been rehabilitated through the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), resulting in 2,535 tonnes of CO2 and 12,681 MWh in heat energy saved.</narrative>

              <narrative>During this reporting period an additional 17,004 People are living in Energy Efficient buildings as a result of the EE measures implemented within the project. 30 more people benefited from the installment of a gas operated central heating unit in  Calan Municipality ("City Hall B unit"), so the civil servants of the Municipality will benefit of better working conditions. Through the National Thermal Rehabilitation Programme, an additional 10563 people are living in thermally retrofitted buildings (calculated at an average of 3persons/apartment). Through the ‚ÄúCasa Verde‚Äù programme financed by the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests, 6441 people (based on an estimate of 3 people/household) benefited from the installment of sustainable heating systems.</narrative>

              <narrative>The project has contributed - through technical input and advocacy - to the amendment and enforcement of the ‚ÄúStrategy for mobilizing investment in the renovation of residential and commercial building stock, both public and private, at a national level‚Äù of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, thereby creating an enabling environment for mainstreaming EE into national and local programmes and projects, with a particular focus on poor households. Through the implementing partner, MDRAP, the project contributed to the formulation of Legislation no. 180/2015, for the amendment of Government Ordinance no. 18/2009, so that owner association can have a better access to the funds allocated from the National Rehabilitation Programme. The project has developed a complementary study to the methodology for fuel poverty assessment, providing conclusions and recommendations on future technical and social policies for a better use of social aids as to alleviate fuel poverty, developing the algorithms to calculate:

o the necessary/usual heating demand/requirements for households and heat losses evaluation in order to assess fuel poverty in Romania;

o the impact of thermal performance improvement program for buildings on social aid budget.

The study will be submitted to the Ministry of Labor and the Inter-institutional Working Group of the project for validation so its recommendations‚Äô will be formulated as policy recommendations as the basis of proposed legal amendments supported by the Ministry of Labor.</narrative>

              <narrative>The project continues its work with the local municipalities, registering good progress in the mainstreaming of fuel poverty measures into the local development strategies within two municipalities, namely municipality of Vulcan and Craiova Metropolitan Area (out of the 6 pilot municipalities). The two updated strategies are expected to be finalized within 2015. In addition, a set of guidelines for the achievement of Green Cities status (in accordance to EC 2020 strategy) has been developed by the project and discussed with the pilot municipalities‚Äô policy makers‚Äô representatives. The discussions have been followed by bilateral coaching of each municipality exploring the availability of the necessary primary data to be processed for prioritization of the EE measures that will lead the municipality on the pathway to Green Cities.</narrative>

              <narrative>2 building materials production companies were supported by the project within this reporting period. A workshop was organized with the representatives of partner municipalities to promote the sustainable EE insulation material identified within the project (SC Mopatel Proiect Ltd. using as raw material slaked lime), its application modality as exterior insulation material and its‚Äô thermo-technical characteristics and with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of local public-private partnerships (PPPs) in order to produce insulation materials locally and boost local economies.

In 2014 the project has identified a second company (S.C. Melovinic S.R.L. Braila) using local materials for the production of insulation materials (using as raw material wool), that can also be produced locally from locally available, renewable and affordable raw materials, using local workforce in the poor communities.

The project provided support for the accreditation process of both companies in order to obtain the necessary technical agreements for using these materials for public buildings.</narrative>

with focus on ESCO best practices, as a mean to stimulate energy efficiency measures, possibly alleviate fuel poverty and enable a wider access to financing energy efficiency measures. The workshop‚Äôs aim was to stimulate discussions and  explore the feasibility of linking fuel poverty alleviation to ESCO type of investments in poor areas, as a potential way of financing energy efficient building retrofits and lower energy bills, with participation of UNDP Moldova and WWF Hungary representatives.</narrative>

              <narrative>The database registry has not yet been developed, but two working group meetings were organized in this reporting period, bringing together representatives of institutions pursuing national energy and social policies and energy efficiency (EE) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) experts, with a view to analysing and addressing the needs  for collecting, managing and recording the retrofitted residential (apartment blocks) and public buildings, in terms of processing the information on retrofitting for increasing energy efficiency (EE) and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Buildings Registry, currently under development by the project, will be both unique and inter-institutional, the synthetic data reported can and will be used in order to prioritize public investments aimed at increasing energy efficiency in buildings (handled by the Ministry of Regional Development), reducing of the carbon footprint (pursued by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change) and better allocation of the heating subsidies (by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection) based on the actual dwelling conditions.</narrative>
