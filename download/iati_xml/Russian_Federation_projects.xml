            <comment>Consultations at federal and regional levels confirmed that the updated EE Law does not allow introduction of regional EE legislation/regulations. Currently only mandatory S&amp;amp;L schemes are stipulated by the federal legislation for selected categories of equipment and just for some technical parameters (safety).   During the reporting period a concept of a network of independent test laboratories for testing of household appliances on EE on the basis of the existing regional Standardization, Metrology and Certification (SMC) Centres was agreed with Rosstandart. The network will cover the needs for EE tests on the entire territory of the country. So far 6 SMC Centres were included in the network consisting of 12 laboratories. Procurement procedures for the supply of the laboratories with modern test equipment are almost completed and the laboratories to be equipped during the next reporting period.   An international advisor to support the Monitoring, Verification and Compliance system under development to be hired in the second half of 2015.</comment>

        <description>Direct impact on improved effectiveness in pilot sites = improved management in 489,782 ha through METT Score.


[As per the MTR this indicator is now under Objective; used to be under Outcome 2]


According to the MTR recommendations:

a) This indicator should be upscaled to the level of Objective;

b) Three federal zakazniks in Kalmykia, as well as newly established regional PAs are moved here from the indicator on the indirect impact on PA management effectiveness since the project provides direct impact on improving management effectiveness of these PAs 

Ñ?) The METT score target for Orenburg is revised to be in line with the 40%-50% range increase for other PAs, which would equate to a target of approximately 75 (instead of 90 previously indicated).

d) It was agreed with MTR that  the target is set based on a rationalized analysis of the METT for each PA to assess reasonable and achievable goals by the end of the project (this actually appears to be the case for the original target METT scores, as the target scores do not conform to a single % increase calculation).  As recommended, targets were re-calculated.</description>

            <comment>Consultations at federal and regional levels confirmed that the updated EE Law does not allow introduction of any regional EE construction norms besides the adopted federal ones. Nevertheless the project has submitted the previously developed documents for Vologda Oblast to the National Housing Fund and the Ministry of Construction and Housing for further consideration. Besides, by the request of the Ministry in 2015 the project started developing a verification model of economic efficiency of EE measures applied in newly constructed or renovated houses. The project plans to test the new methodology in the pilot regions.  

During the reporting period some 40 buildings were selected in cooperation with regional administrations of Pskov, Arkhangelsk, and Vologda Oblasts for participation in project’s initiative on leveraging EE investments through ESCOs, special loans, etc. The list of buildings includes budget and municipal sector buildings taking part in EE renovation program for 2015-2016. After their on-site inspection and express audits, feasibility studies are under preparation to attract private investors. 

In May 2015 a round table on investments in EE renovation of buildings was organized by the project with participation of main financial institutions and banks working in the sphere of EE financing in Russia, including Sberbank, Transkapitalbank, etc. The model proposed by the project as a mechanism of extrabudgetary financing of EE renovation of buildings was supported by representatives of Arkhangelsk and Pskov Administrations and was proposed for pilot implementation in 2015-2016 with Project’s technical assistance.

The geoinformation model developed last year was tested in practice in Pskov Oblast and decision was taken to unite it with the Energy Management Information System (EMIS) developed by a UNDP project in Croatia.</comment>

            <comment>In the second half of 2014 a massive introduction of earlier developed educational modules for schoolchildren was initiated. By June 2015 the Project conducted a number of trainings for teachers in the “train-the-trainers” format related to the educational module «How to save electricity in the house». The module will be widely taught in schools starting from September 2015.

The earlier developed educational modules for higher education (bachelors, masters ad PHD levels) will be taught since September 2015 at the North Arctic Federal University, Far Eastern Federal University, Saint-Petersburg State University of Plant Polymers and Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University. Respective agreements were signed with the Universities.

In June 2015 the project started the development of technical concept for an inter-regional training center and a center of distant learning. An agreement was reached with the Ministry of Education about their involvement in distant learning activities with their possible running of the centers in the future.

            <comment>Implementation of municipal and regional level EE programs and energy audits continued in 2015 by Arkhangelsk Regional Energy Efficiency Centre (AOEEC) as an example of sustainability of project results achieved during previous years. AOECC continued wide utilization of the previously developed electronic database and is looking for a possibility of experience exchange with other regional UNDP Projects. As a part of this activity a North Arctic Federal University EE Design Bureau representative took part in a study tour to Croatia where a similar Energy Management Information System (EMIS) software was developed. The latter allows systematic and complex approach to energy data monitoring and analysis in accordance with the modern standards. During the next reporting period installation of a training EMIS demo facility is planned in the North Arctic Federal University and development of a Smart Metering EMIS unit is envisaged at the AOEEC.


Note: Following the MTR the indicator was reformulated with a specific reference to EMIS introduction in Arkhangelsk.</comment>

        <title>Indicator 1</title>
        <description>During the mid-term Project Evaluation it was decided to split the initial indicator in 3 blocks which reflect: 

(1) production sites and energy sector licensed areas covered by the improved biodiversity management (indirect project impact);

(2) direct impact of the Project resulted in the avoidance, reduction, restoration and offsetting in the Pilot Regions;

(3) indirect impact of the Project where the Project contributed to the implementation of the avoid-reduce-restore-offset biodiversity principle. 

This revision ensures the transparency and clear evidence of the Project direct and indirect impact in the reporting in hectares, and aimes to avoid the misinterpretation of the achievements and the double-counting.

            <comment>1) indirect impact, companies' production sites,  5 000 000 ha cumulative since the Project start: approximate area of all RusHydro HPPs + 3 coal sites of KTK):

-  5 000 000 ha RusHydro implemented IHA Sustainability Protocol into the corporate Biodiversity Assessment Standard. For this the Project had prepared the Guidelines and the Roadmap in 2013-2014;

- 2 129 ha following certification (in 2014) of  KTK Coal Company according to ISO 14001:2007 (Environmental Management System, meaning biodiversity risk) following the Agreement between the Company and the Project.

In 2015 Lukoil, Rosneft, Gazprom and Novatek developed the corporate Arctic Biodiversity Conservation Programmes following the recommendations of the Project to incorporate IOGP/IPIECA, IFC/WB, ISO and Arctic Council best biodiversity practices (impact area with monitoring programmes implemented will be assessed next year).


2) direct project impact 104 498 ha achieved: 

- 104,478 ha in Amur Oblast  covered by Bureyskiy Nature Park established according to the Project proposal (offset);

- 20 ha in Lower Volga Region – restoration of biodiversity in the ecosystems of Sazanye and Zapornoye lakes (restored).

In progress: 154 ha of protected plant species habitat in Amur Oblast will be offseted in another near-by place as recommended by the Project

8 ha of historical oil polluted site in Astrakhan Oblast are included as “hot-spot” for the liquidation under the Federal Programme following the studies conducted under the Project (restored).


3) indirect impact 20 358 027 ha:

- 20,000,000 ha – North Caspian known shelf Oil&amp;amp;Gas licensed areas covered by Ashkhabad (Biodiversity) Protocol of Tehran Convention. The Project financed the preparation of the justification materials for the Meeting of the Parties signed the Protocol in Feb, 2015;

- 320,000 ha covered in NAO’s protected landscapes by Environmental Monitoring Programme of Oil&amp;amp;Gas Company Pechora LNG, Ltd. (Programme developed jointly with the Project);

- 470 ha in Komi Republic have reduced impact due to the implementation of the best recultivation methods applied by Lukoil Oil&amp;amp;Gas Company verified by the Project-sponsored studies;

- 1,000 ha of Karakan Ridge Refuge in Kemerovo Oblast are under the regular ecosystem monitoring;

- 2,500 ha of rocky steeps in Kemerovo Oblast and Khakassia Republic avoided from the coal exploration as corporately agreed by Coal Companies;

- 27,577 ha in Amur Oblast are under restricted industrial activities or recreational use to ensure the sustainability of Bureyskiy Natural Park established according to the Project proposal;

- 6,480 ha in Lower Volga Region – restoration of ecosystem functions through the local water management.</comment>

Score = 2 / 6 (Biodiversity considerations are mentioned in sector policy through specific legislation however there are no regulations in place yet). Current score achieved through the following:

- The Project expert materials were used in the preparatory process for the Biodiversity Protocol to Tehran Convention on the Protection of the Caspian Sea. The Protocol signed in Feb 2015 will prescribe improved biodiversity management for all Oil&amp;amp;Gas Companies working in Russian sector of the Caspian Sea.


- In 2014 Sakhalin Oblast Environmental Council approved Sakhalin BAP Concept initiated by the Project to be followed-up with Sakhalin Oblast Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan with future endorsement by Sakhalin Oblast Administration.


- The Project supported Astrakhan Oblast Administration to develop and endorse new regional law on Biodiversity Conservation. The Project team worked closely with the Administration to include specific biodiversity requirements and harmonise regulations for regional PA establishment.</comment>
